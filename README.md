# Discription of project:

This will be the longerst project yet where by the goal is to deploy on a server a
simple copy of the AirBnB webite. only the fundamental concepts of the higher level 
programming track will be covered.

The web application will be composed with the following:
 * A command interpreter to manupilate data witout a visual interface
   like shell.
 * a website (the front end) that shows the final product to everybody
   wheater static or dynamic
 * A Database or files that store data (data = objects)
 * An API that provides a communication interface between then front-end 
   and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

# Discrition of the command interpreter:

This command line interpreter works as the frontend of the web application that allows 
users to interact with the backend that is developed with pyton OOP programming.
